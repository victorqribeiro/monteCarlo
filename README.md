## About

I made this experiment to test how long it would take to train my neural network with MNIST and how accurate it would be at the end. Turns out I have a long way to go.

## How to use it

Canvas - Draw the image you want to calculate the area from.

Input - Enter the number of samples to be used in the simulation, in the input box.

Solve - Click to solve the aproximate area of the drawn image. You can click solve multiple times to get different results.

Clear - Clear the canvas.
